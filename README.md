# PNA_Impulse
XPP and Matlab code to accompany the manuscript "Bifurcation analysis of an impulsive system describing Partial Nitritation and Anammox in a hybrid reactor"

# Code developed and maintained by Dr. Matthew J. Wade (matthew.wade@ncl.ac.uk, dr.matthewwade@googlemail.com)

Impulse.ode : An XPP (http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bard/xpp/xpp.html) file that can be used to simulate the impulsive system of ODEs and find the initial values of the state variables on the positive impulse points (period orbit). Run for t long enough to guarantee convergence to the periodic orbit. This may be confirmed by inspecting the Poincar√© Map intersecting the period orbit such until sequential points are constant.

To use the following code, ensure that MatCont for maps (https://sourceforge.net/projects/matcont/files/matcontm/matcontm5p4/) is installed and added to your Matlab path.

# Main bifurcation code to generate transcritical bifurcation curves (branch curves)

branch_curves.m : Run continuation from the initial impulse points identified using XPP, find the transcritical bifurcation and follow the curve in two parameter space

pna_sys.m : The system of impulsive Ordinary Differential Equations (PN/A model), executed within branch_curves.m

# Code to generate contour maps of the performance indices. NB. The data generated by branch_curves.m can be used to plot the requisite curve over the contour map, as shown by Fig. 2 in the manuscript

performance_init.m : Initialise two parameter space to calculate performance metrics (Hydraulic Retention Time and Nitrogen removal efficiency) in the admissable operating region

ODE_performance_grid.m : Calculation of performance metrics in selected parameter space. Plots a contourmap of the resulting values

ImpulseA.m : Calculation of the impulsive map, identical to the XPP code (Impulse.ode) but here used to solve the system until quasi steady-state to determine the system performance

RADAUsolver.m : Third-party numerical solver for stiff problems (Runge-Kutte first-order Differential Algebraic Equation solver), numerically more stable that Matlab's in-build solvers (E. Hairer and G. Wanner, University of Geneva).
